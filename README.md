### Project Information

This is a project to demonstrate adaptive web page development and showcases the uses of the media query to make responsive layouts. It also is my first time working from a Figma Design.

This was made purely with HTML and CSS. Although it is not fully functional, it shows how the design should look once functional.

In the future, I may try to integrate flexbox into the card layout in place of grid to try to make things look a little better.
