### Project Information

This is a project to demonstrate adaptive web page development and showcases the uses of the media query to make responsive layouts. It also demonstrates the use of javascript to access html elements and their data in order to create a functional profile interface.

This was developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The webpage now has an editable profile name and description. The 'posts' or cards below the profile also are now dynamically loaded onto the webpage rather than being statically generated.

In the future, the webpage will give the ability to add, remove, and edit the posts below the profile section.
