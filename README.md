### Project Information

This is a project to demonstrate the implementation of dynamic modals and form submission handling with JavaScript to be able to create elements from a template appear on a webpage. It also demonstrates the use of javascript to create functions within elements generated by itself.

This was developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The webpage now has functioning post creations, like and delete buttons, and now viewing capabilities of the post. The posts are now generated using a more advanced foreach loop to render the default posts.

In the future, the webpage will possibly be able to interact with APIs to enable features such as fetching real-time data, storing posts in a database, and/or much more.
