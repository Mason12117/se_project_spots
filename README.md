### Project Information

This is a project to demonstrate the implementation of dynamic form validation and event handling with JavaScript to be able to validate form fields realtime. It also the accessability of different functions thorughout multiple scripts, loaded on the same page.

This was developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The webpage now has functioning form validation, 2 new ways to exit a modal, and now demonstrates the use of javascript to keep user data that has been entered but not submitted by a form.

In the future, the webpage will possibly be able to interact with APIs to enable features such as fetching real-time data, storing posts in a database, and/or much more.
